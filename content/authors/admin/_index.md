Hongbin Yan is a research assistant at Nanchang University and is currently awaiting his visa to pursue a PhD at The University of Queensland. His research interests include microalgae–bacteria symbiosis, resource valorization of livestock and poultry anaerobic digestate, and the environmental transformation of antibiotics.

During his master’s studies at Nanchang University, he mainly investigated algae–bacteria interactions, antibiotic removal mechanisms in real anaerobic digestate, and the protein-enrichment potential of Chlorella sp. He obtained his M.S. degree in June 2025. He will subsequently pursue a PhD at The University of Queensland (supported by the CSC-UQ joint scholarship), where he may continue research on antibiotic resistance and related environmental processes.
His current work focuses on:

Microalgae (Chlorella sp.)–bacteria (e.g., Bacillus) consortia for antibiotic degradation, pollution control, and high-value biomass enrichment;
Bacterial transformation of algal-derived dissolved organic matter (DOM) and its role in enhancing antibiotic photodegradation;
Multi-omics approaches—including RNA-seq, FT-ICR-MS, 3D-EEM, and LC-MS/MS—for elucidating environmental bioprocesses.
